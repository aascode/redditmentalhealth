I want to break up with my boyfriend we've been together for almost a year and everytime we ever talk about what would happen if the break up occured he would say something along the lines of suicide and that would honestly guilt trip me a lot to the point where i just try to ignore me wanting to break up so he won't hurt himself. It is a long distance relationship and i've been having these thoughts for a couple weeks. It's where to the point where i want to like take a nap or i'm busy something along the lines of i can't talk right now he puts sad emojis as a way to guilt trip me. We talk a lot and he once asked me to take a picture of myself and send it to him and i said 'No i'm honestly not comfrontable with taking pictures of myself' after i said that he changed my contact name to 'My ex' just to guilt trip me into sending a picture of myself and he always calls me mean and a bit*h because i don't do what he wants.

And if we fail at things we always wanted its hard to pull yourself out if it. I think if she could agree she would and She would be happy for the love and time you gave her. She couldnt love herself so she didnt know how someone else could. Just my thoughts and I think she would want you to know she loved you and wants you to be happy and love yourself...

He unfortunately has debilitating depression and withdraws often. I haven't spoken to him for weeks and it also feels like my first chance at happiness after years has disappeared. I want to be strong and support him, but it hurts me too much that he keeps ignoring me. Letting him go also hurts. Nowhere near the pain in your story I guess, but still hurts that people like us find it so hard to meet someone we connect with and then they're gone before we know it.\n",
      "I want you to tell you that this is not your fault. A few years ago I was dating a guy, because of an accident in his childhood he became deaf. He and I suffer from the same mental illness, schizoaffective disorder. Our illness made us become close to each other and even though he was deaf and I couldn't do any sign language we started dating. At some point I was very suicidal, I did multiple attempts and at some point I figured out my master plan. I don't know exactly why but I told him how id do it, but not when. The day after I was supposed to meet him but I arrived later than I was supposed to. His parents were on holiday and as he's deaf they gave me a house key so it wouldn't be a hassle to get inside. So that day I went to his house, later than I was supposed to and I found him in his room. Hanging, opened wrists and he took an overdose too. Exactly the same way I told him I would do it. I blamed myself many many years and sometimes I realise I still tend to blame myself. But deep down I know it's not my fault. It's the same for you. There's never one reason for someone to kill themselves. There's always multiple reasons and I know she wrote in that letter that you were the last straw but you have to remember she wrote this when she was very emotional and was looking for someone to blame. I know for a fact she wouldn't want you to feel guilty and bad for the rest of your life, I know for a fact that if she could unwrite it she would as I'm sure she wouldn't want you to feel like she did at that moment. You didn't kill her, you're not the reason. I know it's hard to believe and it'll take a long time but you will get there, she would want you to be happy, she would want you to get on with your life, for her\n",

He was the first guy I willingly slept with, first guy I seriously wanted to marry and I genuinely believed I could build a happily ever after with. I knew he had depression and I knew he drank too much.  I had a lot of issues myself. I was young, lived in a very volatile house situation, had a lot of baggage and suffered from a lot of relationship related PTSD.  I had no emotional outlet except him and one day after having a very tough and tiring day I took my anger out on him. I told him he was poisoning my life and that I'd be better off without him. I calmed down after going to sleep and woke up fresh wanting to apologise in the morning. He didn't wake up. Most likely suicide.\n",

I realise now there were signs and that his hospital trip prior was also a failed suicide attempt.

I don't know where these horrible thoughts come from but I know that I would never choose to say anything so intentionally hurtful. My guess is you feel the same way too. That's why sobriety is a beautiful thing. You say that you killed her and I can see why you feel that way but you absolutely cannot blame yourself. She had a mental illness, just like you.

We could learn that more communication is key and put in as much as much truth out of our heads as possible.  For example if we feel a certain way about your partner, i request to immediately ensure that this is conveyed to them. If it might be a bitter message,  it might be initially hard for your partner to take it in but later on they will understand and appreciate your honesty. Now i am not stating that this gentleman had a lack of communication with his late ex girlfriend (rest in peace), but this is the case with most relationships, a sad truth indeed. \n",

This doesn’t have to the end for you. You deserve better. I know you blame yourself for the death of your girlfriend, but you have to remember what you did after she left. You did everything you could to get ahold of her. You tried your best to her how you felt. You need to stop blaming yourself. You’re strong enough to handle this, you know you are.

As I saw myself being ashamed by my own family, forgoten by my recently coupled friends with girlfriends and lost this girlfriend of mine, fuck, one can feel cosmical emptiness inside.
